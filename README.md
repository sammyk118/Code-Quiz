# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

This project is about creating a coding quiz with HTML CSS, and JavaScript, but mainly JavaScript. I had to create and display questions and their choices, and when the user selects the correct answer, the page renders the next question, and the time increments. If they get the answer wrong, the timer decrements.
